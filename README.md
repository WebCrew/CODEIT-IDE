## IMPORTANT NOTE
The other IDE with my name codeit / CODEIT has nothing to do with me or that repository here so please do not send me any emails with support requests etc. The name / which I use since 2013 got "borrowed" from a person who maybe wanted to save the mega work I did to come up with the name. The name sounds good, is easy to remember, has good SEO properties, wasn't used by anyone else at the time, is short and is a great fit for an IDE. I didn't trademark the name because I believed in fairness among coders (pretty naive I know). So I had to accept that someone else benefits from my name.

- I have written to him and asking very friendly with a little fun between the lines for an acceptable solution, with no reply so far. So I'll wait and see if this can be solved peacefully or if the other side reacts cheekily and impudently, but then I can also raise other sides.

- One thing is fact - should he eran only one cent with that name I start to trademark it and every judge will give me the trademark right either way because that person gets the trademark name who can proofe the longest official use of that name (I use it since 2013 in my Emails to partners and since 2015 at GitHub). 

- Who knows maybe I should open a post box company in the USA wait three month until I have full rights there to go to Court and sue him for damages and everyone knows that the US is very generous with the sums.

####Final words
Normally I don't do something like that and be friendly and helpful as always, but I just find it a mess and I really hate people who steal someone's name (or work) even more worse he use it for the same type of product (a IDE) and then if thats not already enough he place it right here at GitHub directly under my nose - that literally calls for a middle finger. I was wondering why the hell I was suddenly getting emails with error messages about Codeit whose source code had absolutely nothing to do with mine - then I did a search and bingo, my Codeit got a unwanted sibling.
