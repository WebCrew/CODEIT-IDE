# INFORMATION

##  Attention: due to lack of time and some new projects, I will not continue to supervise this project or provide updates. It is now up to the community to keep it up to date. Thank you for your understanding.

CODEIT is a simple IDE to handle Javascript, HTML, PHP , CSS, XML, LESS, SQL, MD and allows you to develop HTML5 applications directly online in Your browser (best use with Google Chrome).

Thanks to the Codemirror library developed by Marijn Haverbeke (codemirror.net)
we have created an online IDE with everything you need for the development.  

**You can find CODEIT IDE also at:**
